    <p>
        This 4-ingredient hamburger casserole is so comforting and easy to make, and leaves plenty of room for you to doctor it up as you see fit.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>227 g pasta</li>
        <li>454 g ground beef</li>
        <li>salt, freshly ground black pepper, and garlic powder, to taste</li>
        <li>283 g tomato soup, canned or homemade</li>
        <li>283 g shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain pasta, reserving about 2 tablespoons pasta water.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Drain and discard grease.</li>
        <li>Place ground beef in a large round casserole dish. Add pasta on top; sprinkle with half the cheese. Pour tomato soup on top; add reserved pasta water and stir everything together well. Cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, covered, for 15 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Bake, uncovered, 10 minutes more. </li>
        <li>Turn on the oven's broiler and set a rack 6 inches from the heat source. Broil casserole until cheese is browned, about 2 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve.</li>
    </ol>
