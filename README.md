## Introduction

The **Recipes** project is a foundational exercise from [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). It focuses on creating a simple, static webpage to showcase multiple recipes using basic HTML. Through this project, I will demonstrate my understanding of fundamental HTML concepts, including proper use of elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links to structure content effectively.

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated:
- The ability to structure a webpage using semantic HTML.
- Skills in organizing content in a clear and user-friendly way.
- Practical application of linking between multiple pages within a website. 

This project serves as an essential stepping stone in learning web development and building more complex websites in the future.
